## Drivers

(Agile + SCRUM + Lean + bit of RUP?)
Learning from success and failures from RUP + CMMI and first years of Agile + Lean, we got the following drivers:
The Software Architect is for the whole project, full time, with the team! (Pig and not chicken)*
*Reference to pig and chicken
fable
from Scrum

No waste: only run processes and patterns which leads to agility and quality
Processes and templates needs to be detailed, customized and followed

Let's study responsibilities, processes and templates but what matters is the backlog delivered with quality and agility!

Clear responsibility of roles: What each one does?
Incremental architecture leads to faster deliveries: However, risk management and technical backlog must be more accurate, so critical tasks are not done incorrectly



## Slide 4


# Architecture Practices


## Slide 5


# The process is organized into 20 practices!


## Slide 6


## A

## practice

## has a

## goal.

## Ex: Technical Refinement


## Goal:

## Stories technically detailed and

## ready!



## Slide 7


## Practices

## are grouped into perspectives


Ex:
Technical Refinement
is inside
Architecture Delivery


## Slide 8

Ex: Architecture Definition & Evaluation



## Practices

## that ensure architecture to be defined (or evaluated) and validated according to non-functional requirements of the system.

## Slide 10

3 perspectives which practices are from the contract

## Architecture Delivery


## Architecture Definition and Evaluation


## Architecture Management


## Slide 11

1 perspective of corporate practices, horizontal

## Enterprise Architecture


## Slide 12

Software Architects do Arch. Management? Yes!
Mid-Level Architects only do Arch. Delivery? No!
System Architects do Architecture Definition? Yes!

## Focus of each role

## Slide 13

The difference between Executor and Responsible


## Executor

## is who implements

## .


## Responsible

## is who must implement or

## guarantee that must be done.



## Slide 14


# RESPONSIBLE
THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECT IS

FOR ALL PRACTICES



## Slide 15


## Not necessarily the executor
(on contrary of what many architects and managers may think)

Have a Developer that can make CI? Great!

Have an Technical SM that can make Technical Refinement? Great!
