# Architecture Definition and Evaluation

## Slide 1

What's Software Architecture?

# Architecture Definition & Evaluation


## Slide 2



## Slide 3


## Goal:

## Define proper solutions for the challenge!


## Slide 4

This group of practices aims to guarantee that a consistent architecture was defined, validated and properly communicated to the client. A good architecture definition should take into consideration a number of factors, envisioning to deliver value to the client. Those factors may be technical (non-functional requirements, client’s technical standards) or non-technical (simplicity, productivity etc).

## Goal


## Slide 5

Architecture Document (with definition, NFR) a.k.a Architecture Decision Record (ADR). Example
here.

Create technical documentation from legacy systems still being supported
Technical quality and architectural diagnosis from legacy systems still being supported
Architecture validation plan and report
Architecture Definition & Evaluation:

## Outputs


## Slide 6

Goal

Design an architecture that solves the problem! Keep in mind:
Client business goals
Functional requirements of the solutions (yes, you need to know!)
Non-functional requirements
Client’s technical standards
Productivity and quality!
Architecture Definition & Evaluation:

## Architecture Definition


## Slide 7

Goal

Understand and document a preexisting architecture. Remember:
Understand the context
Check the setup of project environment and quality of the code (use tools)
Create documentation for key features (perform value analysis)

## Architecture Evaluation


## Slide 8

Goal
Ensure non-functional requirements are built together with the client, validated and agreed between Ci&T and client.
Architecture Definition & Evaluation:

## Non-Functional Requirements


## Slide 9

Goal

Validate architecture through tests in real software
Plan and record architectural tests (it takes time)

Execute and understand architecture tests (it takes time)
Adjust the application and environment, if needed. Re-test (it takes time)

*If it takes time, it needs to enter on backlog and roadmap

Architecture Definition & Evaluation:

## Architecture Validation


## Slide 10

Goal

Properly communicate the architecture, internality (Ci&T teams) and externally (client and stakeholders).
Communicate to the client!
Communicate with the project team!

(Communication tool of the Architect: Architecture document, presentations, diagrams and others. Avoid only "chat")
Architecture Definition & Evaluation:

## Communication & Alignment


## Slide 11

Design an architecture that solves the problem!
Understand and document a preexisting architecture!
Ensure non-functional requirements are built together with client, validated and agreed between Ci&T and client.
Validate the architecture through tests in real software!
Properly communicate the architecture, internally (Ci&T teams) and externally (client and stakeholders)!
