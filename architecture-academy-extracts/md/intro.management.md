## Slide 1

What's Software Architecture?

# Architecture Management


## Slide 2



## Slide 3


## Goal:

## Ensure that all aspects related to Architecture are managed!


## Slide 4

The practices of this perspective envision to guarantee that the architecture and technical risks of the project are managed in a way that support the project to be technically successful (i.e. great product-fit, on-time and on-budget delivery).


## Goal


## Slide 5

Project roadmap (with Architecture activities)
Technical Backlog (Architects backlog)
Risks (technical / architectural)
Technical team development plan (
skills)

Architecture Management:

## Outputs


## Slide 6

Goal
Have a plan for the architecture!
Project Plan - It should have all architecture activities in the roadmap (architectâ€™s view of the project)
Architecture Roadmap - How the architecture will evolve throughout time, technically (e.g: a persistence framework will be removed, which one will replace it?)

## Project Plan & Architecture Roadmap


## Slide 7

Goal
Technical risks managed and mitigation plan in execution!
Technical Risk : any situation or event that may occur and block the software delivery or impact the expected quality (e.g: performance: application will not support 2000 users on peak time).
Template here.

Risks must be raised, discussed, formalized and COMMUNICATED (to the client!)
Risks are not only "concerns": You need to design a mitigation plan so that it does not happen!

## Risks and Blocks Management


## Slide 8

Goal
Have a set of activities that must be performed or followed-up by the architects (architects are responsible, but not necessarily the ones executing the tasks).
Technical Backlog, which complements the business backlog.
Must be known by other leaders/managers (Project Manager, Scrum Master etc).
Preferably formalized and public: Jira or other similar tool.

## Technical Backlog


## Slide 9

Goal
Know the team and support them to develop technically!
Objective evaluations, tabulated and communicated to the team. Template
here
(but you can have your own control).
Must produce a technical development plan (technical gap map without a plan to cover it is not worth it).

Technical risks managed and mitigation plan in execution!
