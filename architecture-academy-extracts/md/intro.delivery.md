# Architecture Delivery

## Slide 1

What's Software Architecture?

# Architecture Delivery


## Slide 2



## Slide 3


## Goal:

## Delivery a good product, with good code!


## Slide 4

Architecture is present on the product built, on the written and customized source code, on the software delivered to the client. Not only in great drawings, diagrams and definitions, which are only communication tools to reach our final goal: a good software.

The goal and success of an Architect job is a product with technical and architectural quality!

## Goal


## Slide 5

An excellent definition of architectural patterns is not worth if they are not used.

A good strategy of high performance is not worth if not correctly implemented.

A good design of layers is not worth if the source code violates those layers and do not follow the naming conventions defined.


## Slide 6


## The Architect must know the code!


## Slide 7

Environment for the team (DEV, QA)
Continuous Integration
Architectural foundation (mechanisms)
Development guides
Refined User Stories (Technical Refinement done)
Implementation plan and Installation guide
Team trained
Code Reviews results
Architecture Delivery:

## Outputs


## Slide 8

Goal
The Architect codes what is relevant from an Architecture perspective:
Build of the architectural framework (foundation) and mechanisms
Critical stories from Architecture perspective
Architecture Delivery:

## Development & Testing


## Slide 9

Goal

A working environment for the team!
Automated continuous integration
Environments (DEV, QA) with quality: stable and complete
Architecture Delivery:

## Environment & CI


## Slide 10

Goal

Deployment without surprises!
Production environment with quality
Deployment planning
Deployment rehearsal and homologation in production environment?

Architecture Delivery:

## Deployment


## Slide 11

Goal

Stories detailed technically, ready!
A good technical refinement is essential to avoid blocks
Refinement takes time
Design according to the team needs: more details, less details?
Architecture Delivery:

## Technical Refinement & Design


## Slide 12

Goal

Guide the team in whatever is needed, architecture or coding!
Guide on a daily basis (on the job)
Plan, prepare and perform trainings, Dojos (be practical)

Architecture Delivery:

## Architecture & Coding Guidance


## Slide 13

Goal

Validate if the source code is good! Check the code!
Manual check (Code Review has its value)
Automated checks (which has value if used)
Automated tests (unit, functional etc)
Architecture Delivery:

## Quality Assurance


## Slide 14

The Architect codes what is relevant from an Architecture perspective.
Working environment for the team!
Deployment without surprises!
Stories detailed technically, ready!
Guide the team in whatever is needed, architecture or coding!
Validate if code is good! Check the code!
